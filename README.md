## Background
Idea behind the project was to learn how to use Vue to make frontend applications.
This then became expanding to making a backend with Express and Node in order to support chat functionaility.

## Technologies
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Express
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript

## Requirements to run the project
Node should be installed on your system. 

## Setup
Before running the project cd into the server and then later into the client folder, each time entering in to the terminal:
```
npm install
```
This will install the dependecies needed by the project in the server and the client. Be sure to enter this in the terminal under boot those directories, one a t a time.

## Running the Project
As a result of it's client server architecture, you are required to start up the two halves separtely, as in the installation. First the server with
```
cd server
npm start
```

then cd out of the sever folder and then
```
cd client
npm start
```

Once the boot process is complete, you can then view the website from https://localhost:5173/home (if you are using default configurations). 

## Trying out the Application

|email0@email.com|password|
|email1@email.com|password|
|email2@email.com|password|

and so on up until email11@email.com



## Project Shortcommings
I could have focussed some more on testing, thought some testing is present. It was difficult to find a meaningful way of testing sockets directly without manually testing the frontend of the application.
Something that seems a hassle, when I just originally wanted the project to be a frontend project.
